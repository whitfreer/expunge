  Can I get my juvenile record erased?

<p>
Answer a few questions to find out.
</p>

<br><br>

<p>
If you were arrested in CT when you were under 18, you probably have a juvenile record.
</p>
<p>
A juvenile record does not go away on its own. You are better off without one because having a record can make it hard to get a job, get into college or the military and even to rent an apartment.  The good news: most juvenile records can be erased.
